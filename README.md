# QontoDemo

* Architecture of the app:
- The demo follows an MVP pattern where each screen has a view , a presenter and a screen interface
to support communication from the presenter to the view, the presenter never uses any android specific
api so that it can be testable.

* Explain your choice of libraries
- Usage of dagger to simplify providing dependencies and facilitate testing and decouple components.

* What was the most difficult part of the challenge ?
- Finishing all i would've liked done in the required time.

* Estimate your percentage of completion and how much time you would need to finish
- Almost 85% , an extra 40 to an hour will suffice to finish it all i think.
